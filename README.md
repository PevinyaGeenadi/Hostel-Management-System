## 📚 Case Study

The D24 Hostel, located in Colombo, accommodates university students from various campuses. With a capacity for 125 students, the hostel caters to both genders. However, manual record-keeping has become inefficient with the increasing number of students.

To address this issue, a system is needed for student registration and fee management. The process involves:

1. 🏫 Student visits for room reservation and undergoes a simple interview.
2. 👨‍💼 Employee checks room availability and initiates the registration process.
3. 📋 Details about the student, registration date, and room type are recorded.
4. 💵 Student pays key money for the room or promises to pay later.
5. 🆔 Each student registers with their campus ID.
